Architecture Diagram Description for movie_ticket_booking

1. Components:
   - Client (Web/Mobile App): Sends HTTP requests to the API Gateway.
   - API Gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway): Routes requests, validates JWT.
   - Eureka Server: Registers and discovers microservices.
   - Microservices:
     - User Service: Manages authentication and user data.
     - Movie Service: Manages movie information.
     - Showtime Service: Manages showtimes and cinemas.
     - Seat Service: Manages seat locking and booking.
     - Booking Service: Coordinates booking process.
     - Payment Service: Processes payments.
     - Notification Service: Sends notifications.
   - Databases: PostgreSQL for each service.
   - External Services: Payment provider (e.g., Stripe), notification provider.

2. Interactions:
   - Client -> API Gateway: HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.).
   - API Gateway -> Microservices: Routes requests based on path (e.g., /api/booking -> Booking Service).
   - Microservices -> Eureka Server: Register and discover other services.
   - Booking Service -> Showtime/Seat/Payment/Notification Services: REST calls via Feign Client.
   - Microservices -> Databases: CRUD operations.
   - Payment Service -> External Payment Provider: Processes transactions.
   - Notification Service -> External Notification Provider: Sends emails/SMS.

3. Flow Example (Booking a Ticket):
   - Client sends POST /api/booking/book to API Gateway.
   - API Gateway validates JWT, routes to Booking Service.
   - Booking Service:
     - Calls Showtime Service to validate showtime.
     - Calls Seat Service to lock seats.
     - Calls Payment Service to process payment.
     - Calls Notification Service to send confirmation.
   - Each service updates its database.

4. Notes:
   - Use Docker Compose to run services locally.
   - Consider adding RabbitMQ for asynchronous communication in the future.
   - Use Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring.

To visualize, use a diagramming tool like Draw.io:
- Draw boxes for each component (Client, API Gateway, Eureka Server, Microservices, Databases).
- Add arrows to show HTTP/REST calls and database interactions.
- Label arrows with protocols (e.g., HTTP, JDBC).
- Include a legend for colors (e.g., blue for services, green for databases).
